## Introduction

Surely Vue Table is one of the "high-end" components under the [Ant Design Vue](https://www.antdv.com/) team. This component is dedicated to solving complex and high-frequency problems such as big data rendering and chart integration. Using this component, you can smoothly scroll through 100,000 rows and 100,000 columns of data without worrying about page lag causing user complaints and affecting business progress.

Although this component is developed by the Ant Design Vue team, you can still use it in any component library; it is not an exclusive component of Ant Design Vue.

Surely Vue uses virtual scrolling by default to improve rendering speed. Tree data, expanded content, nested sub-tables, row and column merging, automatic row height, horizontal and vertical scrolling, sticky headers, fixed columns, etc., all support virtual scrolling.

Regrettably, this is a commercial component, but don't worry, you can still use it for free, but you cannot remove the watermark, nor can you hide it. We have been looking for a reliable business model while ensuring that Ant Design Vue is completely open source, hoping to obtain certain income through the "high-end" component collection, recruit more technical experts, and develop more functions. I think you can also understand and support us. The commercialization of Surely Vue will help Ant Design Vue grow faster.

It is necessary to state again that Ant Design Vue is not developed and maintained by Ant Financial. Since its birth (2017), it has been developed and maintained by [tangjinzhou](https://github.com/tangjinzhou) together with many professional developers. Surely Vue is a commercial product launched by the team after corporate operation. Four years of continuous persistence have been recognized by many developers. You don't have to worry about it being a KPI product that will be abandoned in the end, and you don't have to worry about individual developers running away, because we have many paid enterprise customers and we have healthy and sustainable stable income.
