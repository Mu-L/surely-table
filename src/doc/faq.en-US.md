## FAQ

### Does it support other component libraries?

Yes, Surely Vue Table is a component based on Vue 3. We do not limit the use of component libraries. You can still use your existing component libraries.

### What is the relationship with Ant Design Vue? Why not integrate it into Ant Design Vue?

Surely Vue is developed and maintained full-time by the Ant Design Vue technical team. While ensuring that Ant Design Vue is completely open source, we are constantly looking for reliable business models. We hope to obtain certain income through Surely Vue, and then recruit more technical experts to develop more functions.

We also expect this to be an independent component that you can easily integrate into various component libraries.

### What are the differences between different versions?

All versions have the same functions, they only differ in the authorized domain name.

Standard Edition and Professional Edition authorize domain names in a certain standard format.

Max Edition authorization does not limit domain names.

About authorized domain names: If your domain name is `admin.baidu.com` and you purchased the Standard Edition, then the license key cannot be used on sites other than `admin.baidu.com`. Conversely, if you purchased the Professional Edition or Max Edition, then your license key can be used under any domain name under `baidu.com`.

If you clearly know that your application only runs under a specific domain name, you can choose the Standard Edition, and we support upgrading to the Professional Edition or Max Edition by paying the price difference within three months.

But you must know that once the domain name is authorized, it cannot be changed.

### What does update right mean?

After obtaining authorization, you will have the permanent right to use Surely Vue, but only one year of update rights.

For example: You purchased a version with one-year update rights on November 11, 2021, then as long as it is a version released before November 11, 2022, you can upgrade and use it permanently. However, versions released after November 12, 2022 cannot be upgraded and used. If necessary, you can repurchase the authorization.

### Do future new components need extra payment?

No, we will constantly adjust the price as the number of components increases, but customers who purchased in the early stage do not need to pay extra. However, if you only purchased one year of update rights, then beyond the update time range, you need to pay again to use the latest components or functions. Of course, you can purchase the lifetime update right version. In short, as long as you still have update rights, you can use new functions or components.

### Can I issue an invoice, transfer to a corporate account, or sign a contract/agreement?

Of course, you can consult customer service for detailed information.

### Is technical support provided?

We provide one year of ticket technical support and DingTalk technical group support.

### Does it support changing domain names?

If you purchased the Max Edition, you can skip this question.

But for the Standard Edition and Professional Edition, we are sorry that we cannot support the service of changing domain names. Please fill in the correct domain name carefully before purchasing. Once the domain name is authorized, it cannot be changed. If you need to change it, you have to repurchase a new domain name authorization certificate.

### What are the advantages compared with other free and low-price similar products?

We don't want to belittle any products, especially open source products. We admire them very much. It is not easy to persist in open source. If you are using them, appropriate rewards and sponsorship are very necessary. Generating electricity with love is not a sustainable thing. In order for your project to continue to use them, please buy the author a cup of coffee.

If you only need big data rendering, there are many open source products available; if you also need to perform complex operations on big data, such as row dragging, column dragging, tree dragging, editing, sorting, tree display, etc., then Surely Vue is a product with extremely high cost performance.
